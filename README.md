Volume vs. Value: A Grid-Based Analysis of Structural Heterogeneity in Mexican Manufacturing (2010–2025)This repository contains the replication files and source code for the paper:"Volume vs. Value: A Grid-Based Analysis of Structural Heterogeneity in Mexican Manufacturing (2010–2025)" By Francisco BenitaProject OverviewThis project investigates the spatial restructuring of Mexican manufacturing under the USMCA/Nearshoring framework. We use a micro-geographic approach to disentangle the extensive margin (establishment density) from the intensive margin (capital-labor ratios) across a $25\text{km}^2$ grid covering all of Mexico.The core finding reveals a "nearshoring paradox": while export-oriented sectors are drifting north toward the US border, industrial clustering appears to have a negative relationship with technological sophistication, suggesting the emergence of high-tech enclaves rather than mature industrial ecosystems.Repository StructureThe project is organized into two main directories:/scripts: Contains the full end-to-end Python pipeline.01_Dasymetric_Disaggregation.py: The core script that fuses municipal Census data with geocoded DENUE point data to create the grid panel.02_Stage1_Spatial_Poisson.py: Estimates the extensive margin (firm counts) using a Spatial Lag of X (SLX) model.03_Stage2_Intensive_Margin.py: Estimates the intensive margin (capital intensity) using Pooled OLS with time fixed effects.04_Visualizations.py: Generates the bivariate maps and coefficient plots used in the manuscript./data: Contains metadata and sample datasets.data_dictionary.csv: Full list of variables, units, and sources (INEGI/DENUE).sample_grid_data.csv: A sample 5% slice of the panel to test script functionality.Note: Due to the proprietary nature and size of the fully processed longitudinal panel, the complete dataset is available upon reasonable request for replication purposes.Methodology: Dasymetric Data FusionA key contribution of this work is the creation of a high-resolution economic panel. We disaggregate quinquennial Economic Census data (2009, 2014, 2019, 2024) into uniform $5\text{km} \times 5\text{km}$ grid cells. The disaggregation follows a top-down dasymetric logic, where municipal census totals are distributed based on the spatial density of active establishments geolocated via the National Directory of Economic Units (DENUE).RequirementsThe scripts are written in Python 3.10+ and require the following libraries:pandas & numpy: Data manipulation.geopandas & libpysal: Spatial analysis and weight matrix construction.statsmodels: Econometric estimation.matplotlib & seaborn: Visualization.LicenseThis code is licensed under the MIT License.
